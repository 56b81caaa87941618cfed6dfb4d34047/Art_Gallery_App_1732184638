Create a new pool using the createPool function.\n4. Query existing pools using the getPool function.\n5. Get the tick spacing for a given fee using the feeAmountTickSpacing function.\n\nEach interaction includes error handling and will prompt the user to connect their wallet if not already connected. The UI is styled using Tailwind CSS classes for a clean and responsive layout.\n\nPlease note that the createPool function will require the user to have the necessary permissions and tokens to create a pool. Also, the component assumes that the user has MetaMask or a similar Web3 wallet installed in their browser.\n",
